# Machine Learning Practice on the Fruits360 Dataset

This repository contains some models built in Keras on the [fruits360 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) from kaggle. I've added the data to my .gitignore but it can be acquired by download at the above link or via the Kaggle API by the following command:

`kaggle datasets download -d moltean/fruits`
